Hello and welcome to my blog: `The neophyte's logs`. 

I am a neophyte in various things, including but not limited to:
* Programming
* Design
* Math
* English
* Linux


<hr/>


So I am going to use this blog as motivation to learn more about many things - primarily Programming- and hopefully, write daily to describe my progress. <br/>


I don't particularily care if someone is reading this since I am writing for my own personal development, but if someone is, thank you for your support.

 These blogposts are going to be the logs of my journey (Hence the name). <br/>


Thank you for reading this post.

 Look forward to more. 
 
 Until then, so long.
